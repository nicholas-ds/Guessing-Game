# Guessing Game
This is a guessing game that I made for my unit 4 test. The goal of the game
is to use the on screen keyboard or your own personal keyboard to guess each
individual letter in the phrase. I went for the exceeds expectations grade
by allowing the user to use their own keyboard to select the letters shown
on screen, and by personalizing the app style by: 

  - Using more pastel colors. I didn't like how bright everything was before
  - Changing the color of the on screen letters when a wrong letter is pressed
  - On the loose screen the correct phrase is shown so that the user can see 
    what they missed. 
  - I changed the hearts to look like retro video game heart containers.
